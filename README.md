# ðŸŒ·  Per Capita Income  ðŸŒ·
Per capita income or total income measures the average income earned per person in a given area in a specified year. It is calculated by dividing the area's total income by its total population. Per capita income is national income divided by population size.

# ðŸŒ·  Canada Per Capita Income Prediction  ðŸŒ·
Predicting a country's per capita income is a valuable exercise in understanding economic trends and making informed decisions. In this analysis, we will use the Linear Regression algorithm to predict Canada's per capita income based on a single variable, typically a relevant economic indicator. Linear Regression aims to establish a linear relationship between the input variable and the target variable (per capita income).

# ðŸŒ·  Conclusion  ðŸŒ·
e Canada Per Capita Income Prediction analysis using Linear Regression (Single Variable) provides insights into basic predictive modeling in economics. While this simplified approach focuses on a single economic indicator, real-world scenarios consider multiple variables and more advanced models. Linear Regression serves as a foundation for more complex algorithms.

As we engage in this analysis, we recognize the significance of accurate economic predictions in policy-making, investment decisions, and assessing a country's economic health. Linear Regression provides a stepping stone to more advanced techniques that consider various economic indicators, external factors, and dynamic relationships to enhance prediction accuracy.
